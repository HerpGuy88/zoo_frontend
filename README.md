# zoo_frontend

This frontend is built uses the Next.js framework and was initiated from template packaged with Next.js using `create-next-app`.

As such, there are some unused assets that should probably be cleaned up, but at this early stage in development, I appreciate having them for reference.

I configured the app to run on port 8080 so it can be run simulataneously and on the same machine as the backend.

#Installation Instructions:

1. Download the Source Code
   Unzip the provided archive (which can also be downloaded from GitHub)
   OR

2. Now run the following to install dependencies:

3. And that's all that is required to install the frontend! To start the app, run the following command from the root directory of the project:
